  <div class="divider">who am I?</div> 
  
  <div class="inner">
    <p>I am a human that likes to learn, teach, and create.</p>
    <p>I'm currently taking life more slowly.
    I spend most days either on home improvement projects (more on bug fixes than feature requests!)
    and learning new maker skills from TechShop to help me accomplish those projects.
    </p>
    <p>In my past lives, I've...
    <ul>
     <li>Attended a 4 month <a href="http://nyingmainstitute.org">Tibetan Buddhism retreat</a> to learn techniques for relaxation, meditation, and emotional transformation.</li> 
     <li>Founded <a href="https://www.facebook.com/connectionsociety">a company</a> with my partner that puts on events in the bay area to bring people together for genuine fun and deep connection.
     <li>Created the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing">computing curriculum</a> for <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a> and coded <a href="http://github.com/Khan/live-editor">the platform</a> to deliver it.
     <li>Founded the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-San-Francisco/">GirlDevelopIt SF chapter</a> and created much of its <a href="http://teaching-materials.org">CC-licensed curriculum</a>.
     <li>Written oodles of code for <a href="https://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a>, as its 2nd frontend engineer.
     <li>Worked in both Google Mountain View & Google Australia, doing developer relations for the Maps API and Wave APIs.
     <li>Been a bachelors & masters student in the USC Computer Science Department, with minors in 3d Animation + Linguistics.
    </ul>

   <div class="divider">want to contact me?</div>
   <div class="inner">
    <ul>
     <li>If you'd like to report a bug or a feature request with the Khan Academy platform, 
    <a href="https://khanacademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=261028">please use ZenDesk</a>,
    since I am no longer a KA engineer.<br>
    <li>If you would like me to speak at an event, 
    please keep in mind that I do not have an employer now that can pay for travel/time off,
    so I have to say no to most requests.
    I'm most likely to speak at local events, particularly to younger audiences.
    </ul>
    <p>If you're still keen on sending me a message after reading all that, go for it! You can use <a href="http://a.quil.la/YVZPY">this form</a>.</p>
