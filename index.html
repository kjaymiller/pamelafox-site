    <ul>
      <li>If you would like me to speak at a conference, please know that I say no to most requests,
      as I have a young daughter and a full-time job.
      I'm most likely to say yes to local events, events with younger audiences, and events where my partner is paid to attend with me. 
      <li>If you'd like to report a bug or a feature request with the Khan Academy platform,
      <a href="https://khanacademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=261028">please use KA ZenDesk</a>.<br>
